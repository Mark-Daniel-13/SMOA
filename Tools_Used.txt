Project: C# Winforms

Database: MySQL

Db Data User Log In Credentials:
Username: admin
Password: admin123

Note: Please make sure to check database connection string if a problem occur on the connection of database. Verify if the schema security is correct. Please do double check the connectionstring source, id and password if you're using different database credentials.

If database credentials used are different, please do check the connections string for .Data Layer on App.Config. and Rebuild the db  mapping by going to Generated folder>Right click Database.tt and click "Run Custom Tool".

If by any chance it's saying .Data is missing on Facades just go to .Data Layer>Generated folder> Database.tt>Database.cs then change the class namespace from "SMOA" to "SMOA.Data"

Thank you for making me participate on this exam. I hope i'll hear a feedback from you guys soon! Happy Weekends! :)
